     <li>When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent example is "<code data-x="javascript protocol">javascript:</code>", but user agents can implement (and indeed, have historically implemented) others.</li> <!-- IE had vbscript:, Netscape had livescript:, etc. -->

    <p class="example">For example, this specification disallows nesting a <code>section</code> element inside a <code>kbd</code> element, since it is highly unlikely for an author to indicate that an entire section <!--non-normative-->should be keyed in.</p>

   <p>A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations from the expression context. If the QName has a prefix, then there must be a<!-- added 2009-10-27 - https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8062 --> namespace declaration for this prefix in the expression context, and the corresponding<!-- typo fixed 2009-10-27 - https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8063 --> namespace URI is the one that is associated with this prefix. It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no namespace declaration in the expression context. </p>

   <li><p>If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is not an <span data-x="ASCII digits">ASCII digit</span>, then return an error.</p></li>

   <!-- Ok. At this point we know we have a number. It might have trailing garbage which we'll
   ignore, but it's a number, and we won't return an error. -->

   <li><p><span>Collect a sequence of code points</span> that are <span>ASCII digits</span> from <var>input</var> given <var>position</var>, and interpret the resulting sequence as a base-ten integer. Let <var>value</var> be that integer.</p></li>

     <li>Either a U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+) or, if the time-zone offset is not zero, a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-), representing the sign of the time-zone offset</li>

  <h5>Durations</h5>

  <!-- if you add support for year and month durations, then search for MONTHS throughout the spec
  (not just this section) for things that have to change -->

  <p>A <dfn data-x="concept-duration">duration</dfn> consists of <!--MONTHS: either a number of months or--> a number of seconds.</p>

  <p class="note">Since months and seconds are not comparable (a month is not a precise number of seconds, but is instead a period whose exact length depends on the precise day from which it is measured) a <span data-x="concept-duration">duration</span> as defined in this specification cannot <!--MONTHS: consist of a mixture of both--> include months (or years, which are equivalent to twelve months). Only durations that describe a specific number of seconds can be described.</p>

  <div algorithm>
  <p>A string is a <dfn>valid duration string</dfn> representing a <span data-x="concept-duration">duration</span> <var>t</var> if it consists of either of the following:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <!-- The ISO format -->

    <!-- NOTE: ISO durations also have a number of formats we do not
         consider conforming:

         - a "week" format (e.g. P4W). This one is actually supported
           by the parser.

         - P<date>T<time>, with or without hyphens

         - All these formats, with commas instead of periods for the
           seconds decimal

    <p>A literal U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P character followed by one or more of the following subcomponents, in the order given, where <!--the number of years, if any, multiplied by twelve, plus the number of months, if any, equals the number of months in <var>t</var>, if the duration is in months; or, if it is in seconds, -->the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds corresponds to the same number of seconds as in <var>t</var>:</p>

  <!--INSERT TRACKING-->
  Since different users having different sets of<span data-x="plugin">plugins</span> provides a tracking vector that increases the chances of users being uniquely identified, user agents are encouraged to support the exact same set of <span data-x="plugin">plugins</span> for each user.</p>
